# OodieeðŸ¥‡
"Oodiee" is an exciting endless runner(swimmer) where you take control of the determined
character, Oodiee. Navigate through a procedurally generated underwater world, dodging
obstacles that appear along the way. The game progressively increases in difficulty, providing
a challenging experience as you strive to achieve high scores. Collect power-ups to gain
temporary advantages and swim further. Immerse yourself in the vibrant visuals and addictive
gameplay of Oodiee as you embark on an endless aquatic adventure!
 
Oodiee was created as an entry in the OpenIT 2023 GameJam and it was awarded first
place by the judges. Me and two other friends created it in under 30 hours.
